      <h1>Conditions</h1>
      <p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p>
      <p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p>
      <p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.</p>
      <h2 id="Blinded">Blinded</h2>
      <div>
      <ul><li>A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
      <li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
      </ul></div>
      <h2 id="Charmed">Charmed</h2>
      <ul><li>A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>
      <li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature</li>
      </ul><h2 id="Deafened">Deafened</h2>
      <ul><li>A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</li>
      </ul><h2 id="Exhaustion">Exhaustion</h2>
      <div>
      <div>
      <p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</p>
      <table><tr><th>Level</th>
      <th>Effect</th>
      </tr><tr><td>1</td>
      <td>Disadvantage on ability checks</td>
      </tr><tr><td>2</td>
      <td>Speed halved</td>
      </tr><tr><td>3</td>
      <td>Disadvantage on attack rolls</td>
      </tr><tr><td>4</td>
      <td>Disadvantage on saving throws</td>
      </tr><tr><td>5</td>
      <td>Hit point maximum halved</td>
      </tr><tr><td>6</td>
      <td>Speed reduced to 0</td>
      </tr><tr><td>7</td>
      <td>Death</td>
      </tr></table><p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</p>
      <p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p>
      <p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p>
      <p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. If you have more than 2 levels of exhaustion, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of a long rest to reduce the exhaustion. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.</p>
