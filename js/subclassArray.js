Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p><h2>Path of the Ancestral Guardian</h2><hr><p>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.</p><p>Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</p><h2>Ancestral Protectors</h2><hr><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</p>",

When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",

The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p><h2>Frenzy</h2><hr><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</p><p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>",

If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.</p><p>Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</p><h2>Storm Aura</h2><hr><p>When you select this path at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 3 meters from you in every direction, but not through total cover.</p><p>Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.</p></p>If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p><p><strong>Desert.</strong> When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 1d4 fire damage each.

The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.</p><p><strong>Tundra.</strong> When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 1d4 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering.

The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p><p><strong>Desert.</strong> You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.</p><p><strong>Sea.</strong> You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><strong>Tundra.</strong> You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold.

On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to your Barbarian level.</p><p><strong>Sea.</strong> When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.</p><p><strong>Tundra.</strong> Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.</p>"

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p><h2>Path of the Totem Warrior</h2><hr><p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</p><p>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p><h2>Spirit Seeker</h2><hr><p>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals.</p><h2>Totem Spirit</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p><p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p><p><strong>Bear.</strong> While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</p><p><strong>Eagle.</strong> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</p><p><strong>Elk.</strong> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 5 meters. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.</p><p><strong>Tiger.</strong> While raging, you can add 3 meters to your long jump distance and 2 meters to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.</p><p><strong>Wolf.</strong> While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within reach of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p>",

You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p><p><strong>Bear.</strong> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.</p><p><strong>Eagle.</strong> You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 2 kilometers away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 30 meters away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p><p><strong>Elk.</strong> Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 20 meters of you and you're not incapacitated. The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.</p><p><strong>Tiger.</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.</p><p><strong>Wolf.</strong> You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf.

You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p><p><strong>Bear.</strong> While you're raging, any creature within 1 meter of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.</p><p><strong>Eagle.</strong> While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p><p><strong>Elk.</strong> While raging, you can overrun creatures as a bonus action. When you do so, the creature also takes an additional 2d6 + your Strength modifier damage.</p><p><strong>Tiger.</strong> While you're raging, if you move at least 4 meters in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.</p><p><strong>Wolf.</strong> While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.</p>"
