    "primalPath":"<h2 id='PrimalPath'>Primal Path</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage from the list of available paths. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p><h2>Path of the Ancestral Guardian</h2><hr><p>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.</p><p>Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors' deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.</p><h3>Ancestral Protectors</h3><p><i>Path of the Ancestral Guardian Feature</i></p><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage. While you're raging, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your rage ends.</p>",

If you are raging and another creature you can see within 10 meters of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.</p><p>When you reach certain levels in this class, you can reduce the damage by more: by 3d6 at 10th level and by 4d6 at 14th level.</p>",
    "pathFeature2":"<h2 id='PathFeature2'>Path Feature</h2><hr><p><i>Path of the Ancestral Guardian Feature</i></p><p>At 10th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Consult the Spirits</h3><p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the augury or clairvoyance spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><p>After you cast either spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",
    "pathfeature3":"<h2 id='PathFeature3'>Path Feature</h3><p><i>Path of the Ancestral Guardian Feature</i></p><p>At 14th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Vengeful Ancestors</h2><hr><p>At 14th level, your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes an amount of force damage equal to the damage that your Spirit Shield prevents.</p>"

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p><h3>Path of the Berserker</h2><hr><p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p><h3>Frenzy</h3><p><i>Path of the Berserker Feature</i></p><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</p><p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>",
    "pathFeature1":"<h2 id='PathFeature1'>Path Feature</h3><p>At 6th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Mindless Rage</h2><hr><p><i>Path of the Berserker Feature</i></p><p>Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.</p>",
    "pathFeature2":"<h2 id='PathFeature2'>Path Feature</h3><p>At 10th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Intimidating Presence</h2><hr><p><i>Path of the Berserker Feature</i></p><p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 10 meters of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 20 meters away from you.</p><p>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>",

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p><h3>Path of the Storm Herald</h3><hr><p>All barbarians harbor a fury within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic, which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful magical effects.</p><p>Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.</p><h3>Storm Aura</h3><p><i>Path of the Storm Herald Feature</i></p><p>When you select this path at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 3 meters from you in every direction, but not through total cover.</p><p>Your aura has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action. Choose desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.</p></p>If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.</p><p><strong>Desert.</strong> When this effect is activated, all other creatures in your aura take 1d4 fire damage each. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 10th level, 1d10 at 15th level, and 1d12 at 20th level.</p><p><strong>Sea.</strong> When this effect is activated, you can choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 15th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.</p><p><strong>Tundra.</strong> When this effect is activated, each creature of your choice in your aura gains 1d4 temporary hit points, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 10th level, 1d10 at 15th level, and 1d12 at 20th level.</p>",
    "pathFeature1":"<h2 id='PathFeature1'>Path Feature</h2><hr><p>At 6th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Storm Soul</h3><p><i>Path of the Storm Herald Feature</i></p><p>At 6th level, the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p><p><strong>Desert.</strong> You gain resistance to fire damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme heat. Moreover, as an action, you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.</p><p><strong>Sea.</strong> You gain resistance to lightning damage, and you can breathe underwater. You also gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><strong>Tundra.</strong> You gain resistance to cold damage, and you don’t suffer the effects of extreme cold. Moreover, as an action, you can touch water and turn a 1-meter cube of it into ice, which melts after 10 minutes. This action fails if a creature is in the cube.</p>",
    "pathFeature2":"<h2 id='PathFeature2'>Path Feature</h2><hr><p>At 10th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Shielding Storm</h3><p><i>Path of the Storm Herald Feature</i></p><p>At 10th level, you learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has the damage resistance you gained from the Storm Soul feature while the creature is in your Storm Aura.</p>",
    "pathfeature3":"<h2 id='PathFeature3'>Path Feature</h2><hr><p>At 14th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Raging Storm</h3><p><i>Path of the Storm Herald Feature</i></p><p>At 14th level, the power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes. The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.</p><p><strong>Desert.</strong> Immediately after a creature in your aura hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage equal to your Barbarian level.</p><p><strong>Sea.</strong> When you hit a creature in your aura with an attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by a wave.</p><p><strong>Tundra.</strong> Whenever the effect of your Storm Aura is activated, you can choose one creature you can see in the aura. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn, as magical frost covers it.</p>"

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p><h2>Path of the Totem Warrior</h2><hr><p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</p><p>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p><h3>Spirit Seeker</h3><p><i>Path of the Totem Warrior Feature</i></p><p>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals.</p><h3>Totem Spirit</h3><p><i>Path of the Totem Warrior Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.</p><p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.</p><p><strong>Bear.</strong> While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.</p><p><strong>Eagle.</strong> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.</p><p><strong>Elk.</strong> While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 5 meters. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.</p><p><strong>Tiger.</strong> While raging, you can add 3 meters to your long jump distance and 2 meters to your high jump distance. The spirit of the tiger empowers your leaps.</p><p><strong>Wolf.</strong> While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within reach of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p>",
    "pathFeature1":"<h2 id='PathFeature1'>Path Feature</h2><hr><p>At 6th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Aspect of the Beast</h3><p><i>Path of the Totem Warrior Feature</i></p><p>At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.</p><p><strong>Bear.</strong> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.</p><p><strong>Eagle.</strong> You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 2 kilometers away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 30 meters away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p><p><strong>Elk.</strong> Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 20 meters of you and you're not incapacitated. The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.</p><p><strong>Tiger.</strong> You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.</p><p><strong>Wolf.</strong> You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.</p>",
    "pathFeature2":"<h2 id='PathFeature2'>Path Feature</h2><hr><p>At 10th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Spirit Walker</h3><p><i>Path of the Totem Warrior Feature</i></p><p>At 10th level, you can cast the Commune with Nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.</p>",
    "pathfeature3":"<h2 id='PathFeature3'>Path Feature</h2><hr><p>At 14th level, you gain a feature from your Primal Path.</p><h3>Totemic Attunement</h3><p><i>Path of the Totem Warrior Feature</i></p><p>At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.</p><p><strong>Bear.</strong> While you're raging, any creature within 1 meter of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.</p><p><strong>Eagle.</strong> While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p><p><strong>Elk.</strong> While raging, you can overrun creatures as a bonus action. When you do so, the creature also takes an additional 2d6 + your Strength modifier damage.</p><p><strong>Tiger.</strong> While you're raging, if you move at least 4 meters in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.</p><p><strong>Wolf.</strong> While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.</p>"

These barbarians are zealots—warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.</p><h3>Divine Fury</h3><p><i>Path of the Zealot Feature</i></p><p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.</p><h3>Warrior of the Gods</h3><p><i>Path of the Zealot Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle.

You still must make death saving throws, and you suffer the normal effects of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would die due to failing death saving throws, you don't die until your rage ends, and you die then only if you still have 0 hit points.</p>"

Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more persuasive than facts.

Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.</p><p>The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, misusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.</p><h3>Mantle of Inspiration</h3><p><i>College of Glamour Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Glamour at 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to grant yourself a wondrous appearance.

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who talks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, although it avoids violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect ends on a target after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if you attack it, or if it witnesses you attacking or damaging any of its allies.</p><p>If a target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Lore</h2><hr><p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p><p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p><p>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p><i>College of Lore Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.</p><h3>Cutting Words</h3><p><i>College of Lore Feature</i></p><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 20 meters of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p><p>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.</p>",
    "collegeFeature1":"<h2 id='Countercharm'>Countercharm</h2><hr><p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 10 meters of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p><h2 id='BardCollegeFeature1'>Bard College Feature</h2><hr><p>At 6th level, you gain a feature from your Bard College.</p><h3>Additional Magical Secrets</h3><p><i>College of Lore Feature</i></p><p>At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.</p>",

Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.</p>"

    "bardCollege":"<h2 id='BardCollege'>Bard College</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Swords</h2><hr><p>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</p><p>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade's talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</p><p>Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves' guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p><i>College of Swords Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Swords at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and a martial weapon of your choice that deals slashing damage.</p><p>If you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon that deals slashing damage, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</p><h3>Technique of Blades</h3><p><i>College of Swords Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting favored by the blades as your specialty. When you are wielding a melee weapon that deals slashing damage, you can use your Charisma modifier in place of Strength for the attack and damage roll.</p><h3>Blade Flourish</h3><p><i>College of Swords Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you learn to perform impressive displays of martial prowess and speed.</p><p>Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.</p><p><strong>Defensive Flourish.</strong> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Mobile Flourish.</strong> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to 2 meters away from you, plus a number of meters equal to the number you roll on that die minus 1. You can then immediately use your reaction to move up to your walking speed to an unoccupied space within reach of the target.</p><p><strong>Slashing Flourish.</strong> You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any other creature of your choice that you can see within reach of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies.

These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p><h3>Bonus Proficiencies</h3><p><i>College of Valor Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Valor at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and one martial weapon of your choice.</p><h3>Combat Inspiration</h3><p><i>College of Valor Feature</i></p><p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.</p><h2>College of Whispers</h2><hr><p>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like other bards, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.</p><p>Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses a bard's reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, members of this college rarely reveal their true nature. They typically claim to follow some other college, or they keep their actual calling secret in order to infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p><h3>Psychic Blades</h3><p><i>College of Whispers Feature</i></p><p>When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind.</p><p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.</p><p>The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 10th level, and 5d6 at 15th level.</p><h3>Words of Terror</h3><p><i>College of Whispers Feature</i></p><p>At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.</p><p>If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia in its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.</p><p>If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><h2 id='Expertise1'>Expertise</h2><hr><p>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies.

When a humanoid dies within 10 meters of you, you can magically capture its shadow using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or you finish a long rest.</p><p>You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action.</p><p>While you're in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories.</p><p>Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.</p><p>Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.</p>",

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't share a language with you or if it can't hear you. On a successful saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no effect.</p><p>On a failed saving throw, the target is charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It interprets the whispers as a description of its most mortifying secret. You gain no knowledge of this secret, but the target is convinced you know it.</p><p>The charmed creature obeys your commands for fear that you will reveal its secret. It won't risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.</p><p>When the effect ends, the creature has no understanding of why it held you in such fear.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>"
