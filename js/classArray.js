To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish an extended rest.

Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.

You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p><h3>Protection</h3><p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 2 meters of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p><h2 id='Spellcasting'>Spellcasting</h2><hr><p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.</p><h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3><p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish an extended rest. You can choose to expend hit dice when you finish a long rest to regain expended spell slots. You regain one spell slot level for each hit die you spend. For example, if I want to regain a 3rd level spell slot, I need to expend 3 hit dice.</p><p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><ul><li><strong>Spell Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</li><li><strong>Spell Attack Modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</li></ul><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>",
    "lvl3":"<h2 id='DivineHealth'>Divine Health</h2><hr><p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p><h2 id='SacredOath'>Sacred Oath</h2><hr><p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose from the list of available oaths.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p><h3>Oath Spells</h3><p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p><p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p><p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p><h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3><p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p><p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p><p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps change their oath.</p>",

    "lvl1":"<h2 id='ArcaneRecovery'>Arcane Recovery</h2><hr><p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a long rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p><p>For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.</p><p>You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p><h2 id='Spellcasting'>Spellcasting</h2><hr><p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p><h3>Spellbook</h3><p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p><h3>Preparing and Casting Spells</h3><p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish an extended rest. You can choose to expend hit dice when you finish a long rest to regain expended spell slots. You regain one spell slot level for each hit die you spend. For example, if I want to regain a 3rd level spell slot, I need to expend 3 hit dice..</p><p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><ul><li><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</li><li><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</li></ul><h3>Ritual Casting</h3><p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p><h3>Spellcasting Focus</h3><p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p><h3>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h3><p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see 'Your Spellbook').</p><h3>Your Spellbook</h3><p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p>A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.</p><p><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book. </strong>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 3000 wealth, plus the cost of any material components needed to cast the spell. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><p><strong>Copying from a Spell Scroll. </strong>A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p><p><strong>Replacing the Spell Book. </strong>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p><p><strong>The Book's Appearance. </strong>Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>",
