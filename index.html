      <h2>Welcome to AdroviaWorld!</h2>
      <h3>What is AdroviaWorld?</h3>
      <p>This website is a collection of all homebrew systems I use for playing Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. But, fair warning, I have changed substantially many of the base systems it uses. Here is a basic list of everything I have changed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Boons.</b></i> By far the biggest change is that of adding a system known as Boons. Boons are a way to add exponentially more customizability to a given D&D character. This system replaces feats and ability score improvements. If you would like to see a list of all boons, look under "Player" above.</li>
        <li><b><i>Measurement.</b></i> The second biggest change is the conversion of measurement system from imperial units (feet, miles, gallons, etc.) to the metric system (meters, kilometers, liters, etc.). Unlike the standard battlemap spacing of each square being 5 feet, instead each square is 1 meter.</li>
        <li><b><i>Cultures.</b></i> Unlike a standard D&D world, there are no distinct "species" of playable character. All characters are still human, but still belong to their own culture. Each culture has unique body types, customs, and relation to other cultures and people in the world. If you would like to see a list of all cultures, look under "Player" above.</li>
        <li><b><i>Spell Variations.</b></i> I believe that a given magical spellcaster's repertoire of spells should be unique as they are. As such, each spell has a variety of variations a caster can choose from when they learn it. Many of the changes are cosmetic, but others can be significant enough to border on warranting their own spell. If you would like to see all spells and their variations, look under "References".</li>
        <li><b><i>Combat Maneuvers.</b></i> Combat can become a little stale at times when all you can reasonably do is strike at an enemy with your sword over and over again. Therefore, I have added a small amount of additional depth to combat with combat maneuvers. Essentially, you can perform some sort of action against an enemy to give you an advantage in battle. Examples include grappling, sundering of weapons, lunging, tripping, etc. There are also many boons that make performing these maneuvers much more potent. If you would like a full explanation of combat maneuvers, look at "Combat" under "References" above.</li>
        <li><b><i>Magic Items.</b></i> Unlike many other worlds of D&D, magical items in Adrovia are each in an of themselves unique. There is no such thing as just a "+1 sword" or "bag of holding". Each magic item has a storied history, and unique abilities. For example, instead of a "+1 sword", an adventurer may encounter: <br><br><i>Blackcleave, the Sunderer of Madecon.</i> This blacksteel longsword was forged by an Equien smith during the Allowat Restoration. While attuned, this weapon glows a faint purple, which sheds dim light for 4 meters. Additionally, any critical hit you score with this weapon deals an additional 2d6 psychic damage, as screams of torment are unleashed upon the target.<br><br>Additionally, adventurers begin their career with only one attunement slot. This limit may be increased by certain boons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you would like a more in-depth explanation of character creation, look under "Player". If you would like to look at all of the rules, look under "References".</p>
